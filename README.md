# NOTE TO SELF

# THE CHALLENGE
The challenge is to build a signup form using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# MY PROCESS
Using HTML and CSS, i built the form component with all the error messages.
The Error messages were set to a display of none, so that it will not be visible in the design until the submit button is clicked, which i had to set up using JavaScript.
Using Javascript , i set up variables for all the nodes i would be using in my design.
I used an onclick event to changed the display property on the error messages (which were initially set to display:none;) to display:block;
The onclick event was set to check if the values of the of the form was an empty string, if true then it changed the properties on the form
The error icon was set directly using JavaScript.


# CHALLENGES
This being my first JavaScript project came with its fair share of challenges and even at this point some of the features on this projects are not yet properly set and i intende to properly finish this project as i continue learn more on JavaScript. Below are the unfinished parts of the project(Upon fixing, i would write a short note indicating that each of the problems have being fixed) 

(1) The text  in the placeholders are suppose to be empty upon click and i was not able to do that.
(2) There should be a little bit of padding on the error icon
(3) The example email (email@example.com) that pops up pon clicking the form should have a red color
